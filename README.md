Implementation of the "JavaScript For-Loop Assignment" tasks:
Introduction
In this assignment, you will be practicing more with JavaScript for-loops. These challenges will cover counting with loops, using loops with arrays, and combining loops with conditionals.
Instructions
Challenge 1: Multiples of Three
1.	Write a for-loop that counts from 1 to 30. For each number, if it's a multiple of 3, log "Fizz" to the console. If it's not, log the number itself.
Hint: Use the modulus operator (%). If num % 3 equals 0, num is a multiple of 3.
Challenge 2: Looping through Arrays and Modifying Elements
1.	Create an array numberList with numbers from 1 to 10.
2.	Write a for-loop that iterates through each index in the numberList array. Multiply the number at each index by 5, and update the element at that index with the new number.
3.	Log the updated array to the console.
Hint: Access an array element with array[index] and you can update it by assigning a new value.
Challenge 3: Looping through String Arrays
1.	Create a string array wordsArray with words "cat", "window", "bottle", "car", "JavaScript".
2.	Write a for-loop that goes through each index in the wordsArray. If the word at that index has more than 4 letters, log "Long word alert!" to the console. Otherwise, log the word itself.
Hint: Use the length property on strings to check how many characters it has. e.g., "word".length.
Challenge 4: Updating TextContent of a Paragraph
1.	Write a for-loop that counts from 1 to 5.
2.	For each iteration, add the current number to the textContent of a <p> element with an ID of "myParagraph".
Hint: You can select HTML elements with document.getElementById() and modify their textContent.
Challenge 5: Odd Numbers with For-Loops and Conditionals
1.	Write a for-loop that counts from 1 to 20.
2.	Within the for-loop, use an if-statement to check if the current number is odd. If it is, log the number to the console.
Hint: An odd number when divided by 2 has a remainder of 1.
